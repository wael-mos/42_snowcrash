The project goal is to find the password of the command "su flag00".

To do so, let's start to go to the root directory.

"cd /"


After having traveled multiple directory from the root directory "ls -la */*", I noticed that multiples files have as owner or group flagXX or levelXX instead of root. We can try to use the grep command help us filter the info.

"ls -la */* | grep "flag00|level00""

And there we found our first clue, a file named john with flag00 as owner and group.

"cat /usr/sbin/john" result: "cdiiddwpgswtgt"

The result is weird and doesnt match the password of "su flag00"

To decipher this, I used the website "https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher" which allow us to brute force it.

There is many possible result, the one that is very readable is "nottoohardhere".
