Find that /etc/passwd doesn't have the regulary permission, you can actually read it


Download the passwd file :
"scp -P 4242 level01@<snowcrash_ip>:/etc/passwd ."

Since the project PDF mentioned that If you plan to use a specific external software, you must set up a specific environment (VM, docker, Vagrant) Lets get a docker to run John the Ripper (a famous password decryption tool, https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-crack-user-passwords-linux-system-0147164/).

"docker run -it --name ubuntu ubuntu:xenial bash"
"apt update && apt-get install john"

Next to copy the passwd that we downloaded from snow_crash VM into our docker ubuntu
First we need to get the CONTAINER ID from docker with this command

"docker ps"

Next we can copy the file into docker with this command:

"docker cp <src-path> <container_id>:<dest-path>"

Finally use John the Ripper to crack the passwd that we have just copied into the docker :
"john passwd"

you will get an output like this:
```
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 128/128 SSE2-16])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
abcdefg          (flag01)
1g 0:00:00:00 100% 2/3 100.0g/s 139300p/s 139300c/s 139300C/s raquel..bigman
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

you can see the password for the flag01 as "abcdefg"
