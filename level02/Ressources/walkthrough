For this level, we have a file in our directory: "level02.pcap"

A .pcap is a Packet Capture API.

Download the file :
"scp -P 4242 level02@<snowcrash_ip>:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap ."

The file have permissions issues and we cannot open it: 
"chmod 777 level02.pcap"

It seems that we could use a program called wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/#download) to analyze this packet
Let's create a OSX VM to download and use wireshark.

Open level02.pcap with it and go to Analyze -> Follow -> TCP stream and choose UTF-8.

The password contain the hex code 7f, its the control character which represent DEL and 0d, its just \r.
So if we apply the DEL operation manually, we could trim the password and the final password will be

"ft_waNDReL0L"
