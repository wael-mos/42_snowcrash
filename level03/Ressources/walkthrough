This time, we are welcomed with a single file in our directory called "level03".

After some search in google (https://opensource.com/article/20/4/linux-binary-analysis) we will first be suggested to use the command "file" to know which type of file this is.

Now we could see that the file is a "ELF 32-bit LSB executable" and with another quick search, it seems that we can run this file like a C binary executable, so let's go and run this file to see what it does.

"./level03" result : "Exploit me"

Let's try the other command that where suggested by the previous link to anaylize further:
"ltrace ./level03"

From the analysis made by ltrace, we can see that the "Exploit me" was a result from the echo command using a system call.
`system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"`

This means that we could potentially write a fake echo and change the env PATH, and this level03 executable will be calling our echo instead of the real one.

With "ls -la" we can see that the level03 executable has the permission of "-rwsr-sr-x".

The s(SUID) in the permission, means that this executable will be run as the file owner itself, and in this case, the executable will be run as the user flag03.

`echo "getflag" > /tmp/echo; chmod 777 /tmp/echo; export PATH=/tmp:$PATH; ./level03`
